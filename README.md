# MyReads Project

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. I started to develop from Udacity's starter template and edited to make it active and properly working an app.

My app is a personal book list. On the main page 3 different shelves related to users books: 1.Currently Reading 2.Want to Read 3.Read

The user can search and add new books to the list on search panel. On the list page, user can change the shelf and it will be saved.


## Instructions

To install & launch the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
